#Welkin Pollen Index 
##Daily Pollen Updates for Common Allergies

Welkin Pollen Index is a resource for learning the daily pollen severity in a given area. Pollen assessments are shown for common grasses, trees, and weeds followed by a severity value of 1-5.

Using Googleâ€™s Geocoding APi, any location can be found. The coordinates for the given location are used by the BreezoMeter Pollen API to retrieve real-time pollen data for one, two or three days forecast.
